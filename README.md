# KinectFingerMouse
A program which uses a user defined canvas and interprets hand actions and movements to let you control your mouse with a hand.

Directions: First, install the processing library by navigating to sketch> Import Library > Add Library or navigate manually to the sketchbook file and move the file to the "library" folder

Next, run the main file in processing. First, you will  be prompted to define your canvas size. A lasso gesture (holding just a single finger up) will trigger a click/drag, while moving an open hand gesture will trigger the mouse to move proportionally.
